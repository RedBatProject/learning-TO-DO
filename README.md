this link would be great

also search for free domain and add you ip to it


what is hardening?
we should make root not gonna log in via ssh

in /ssh and sshd_config


permit root login make it no

but before that add a user with add user and make its password with passwd so you can log in to it with any other user

install httpd will create a webserver on the vps

also see firewalld and how to open port with it

you can add user in a group which make it act like root WITH PASSWROD! it is usermod -aG(group) wheel new user (which you have created before)

we hove some command for connection to internet like ping to check whether we are connected to internet or no
ip will show our ip address

traceroute (ip) 4.2.2.4 will show the path or way to reach ip who is listenning you!

resolve.conf is for nameservers if you remove name servers or comment them you can still ping ip but not nameserver
so you should always look at this file
nslookup will allso give an ip and tell you some result about nameserver
other methods is dig an ip or nameserver

we also have something funny name mtr an ip it will sent packet to it like ping but it will ping all the servers in between 
you and the ip and show you who is fucking your internet
